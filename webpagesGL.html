	<!-- A para about myself -->
	<p>Hey there! My full name is Gabriel Maxwell Crail-Steinbaker, and I'm an EFY student at NC State.
	I'm certain you already knew that however, being the graders and all, hah! I tend to either do my work...
	...or find my way of filling time with various hobbies and ends. Like, tinkering with HTML, in fact!
	I was very tempted to put sick and radical gifs all over the place, but then again...such beuaty cannot be seen by man's eye.
	Nevertheless, I hope you have an excellent day, and beyond all that, hope you enjoyed my page. Also! I play an excess of TTRPGS. Woot.
